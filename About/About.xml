	<description>Minify More

In Rimworld, some of the structures are minifiable and some aren't. The reasoning behind why some can't be minified seems confusing. This mod tries to apply minification to more of the vanilla objects in the game, while leaving some objects alone. In general, this mod allows most constructed buildings to be minified and a small selection of structures (columns, doors, barricades/sandbags). Lots of thanks go to the mod that inspired this mod: Uninstall Rimworld.
